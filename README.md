# ðŸ…´ðŸ…½ðŸ†‚ Catchall Resolver

CatchallResolver is an [ENSIP-10](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-10-wildcard-resolution) "Wildcard" resolver which proxies all subdomain resolution requests to the parent resolver.  For instance, if `royalfork.eth` has set a "text/email" record to `ens@royalfork.org`, with the CatchallResolver, `sub.royalfork.eth`, `another.royalfork.eth`, and `double.sub.royalfork.eth` will also have text/email records set to `ens@royalfork.org`.  The CatchallResolver works for all ENSIP defined resolver methods (addr, text, contenthash, etc).

CatchallResolver is deployed on mainnet at: [0xca7c4a117baef1b7a122d55ede7216ba6631ac3e](https://etherscan.io/address/0xca7c4a117baef1b7a122d55ede7216ba6631ac3e)

## Use

Like the ENS public resolver, a single deployment of CatchallResolver can be used by many ENS domains.  If you'd like to use CatchallResolver for your domain (such that *.yourdomain.eth resolves to yourdomain.eth):
1. Call the CatchallResolver's `setResolver(node, resolver)` method with:
   - node = Namehash of your domain (eg: `namehash(yourdomain.eth)`)
   - resolver = Address to the "catchall" resolver to which resolution requests are sent (eg: the PublicResolver contract at `0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41`)
2. Set your domain's ENS resolver to "Catchall Resolver"
   - Call the [ENS Registry's](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000000c2e074ec69a0dfb2997ba6c7d2e1e) `setResolver(node, resolver)` with resolver address: `0xca7c4a117baef1b7a122d55ede7216ba6631ac3e`

#### Example

The Namehash of `royalfork.eth` is `f47a153bb881860e9a4390b84b063154e9623c32a1611c73aef2038a134d8eba`, and resolver is `0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41`.

4. Using [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/), test that everything works as expected:
    ```
    const { ethers } = require("ethers");
    const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/3761559e11414fd8afa394df10d77d00");
    
    (async () => {
      for (const name of [
        'royalfork.eth',
        'sub.royalfork.eth',
        'a.b.c.royalfork.eth'
      ]){
        console.log(`${name}`);
        let resolver = await provider.getResolver(name);
        let resolveName = await provider.resolveName(name);
        if (resolver) {
          console.log(`resolver address ${resolver.address}`);
          console.log(`eth address ${resolveName}`);
        } else {
          console.log(`resolver not found for ${name}`);
        }
        console.log(`-----`);
      }
    })();
    ```
    Ouputs:
    ```
